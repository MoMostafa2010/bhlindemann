## 📖 About This Project
Welcome to the bhlindemann project! I’m a designer who codes, based in Dubai. I’m passionate about how things work and love improving them. Currently, I focus on projects like **Wayzi**, which enhances accessibility in design, and **Smart Links**, an easier way to manage links. My journey also includes developing Craft CMS plugins designed to solve real client challenges. I value teaching and mentoring, and I aim to share what I learn with others.
